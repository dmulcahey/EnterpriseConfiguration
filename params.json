{"name":"Enterprise Configuration","tagline":"A simple library to handle the configuration of multi environment / multi instance java based applications","body":"### What is it?\r\nApplication configuration is usually a major source of deployment and runtime issues.  Configuration of applications that can run in multiple sites is a complex process. Sometimes it is ad-hoc, sometimes it's assembled at deployment time or during the build of the application, and most times information ends up duplicated in multiple locations.  Further, versioning, tracking, and debugging configuration data is a drain on development resources. Configuration of applications can be extremely tedious and complex. When it is done incorrectly it can have a negative impact on the end user. This library aims to make application configuration sensible, simple, and easy.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nThe library is built on top of Commons Configuration and Google Guava. Currently it supports File Based configurations loaded from the classpath.\r\n\r\n### Convention over configuration...\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n### Road map\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
